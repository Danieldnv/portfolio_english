I have listed below a few projects that I have completed using R, Python, and LaTeX. *More projects can be found [here](https://github.com/Danieldnv).*

# Exploring PNADc microdata 
In this project, I used the PNADcIBGE package to collect data from the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (PNADc), which investigates general characteristics of the Brazilian population, such as education, income, and employment.
By applying functions from the survey and convey packages to the obtained microdata, I was able to calculate several key socioeconomic indicators for the Brazilian economy. Among the main results are:  
* Brazilian unemployment rate: 6.4%
* Unemployment rate in the Recife Metropolitan Region: 11.81%
* Average income of overall Brazilian population: 3,267.7 reais; Brazilian women: 2,817.6 reais; Brazilian men: 3,605.2 reais; black woman in the state of Pernambuco: 2,151.2 reais.
* Unemployment rate of white women aged 20-30: 8.479%.
* The racial composition of the Brazilian population (approximated values): 42% are white; 10% are black; 0.6% Asian; 46% brown; 0.4% indigenous; and 0.01% ignored (The definition of each race is according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics).  

*All data refer to the third quarter of 2024*  
This analysis provides valuable insights for understanding Brazil’s labor market and income distribution, supporting socioeconomic research and policy assessment.

# Closing prices of Tesla and Apple stocks  
Using the yfinance library, I collected data on Tesla and Apple stocks through Yahoo Finance’s API. From the retrieved dataset, I extracted the closing prices and created a visual representation showing, for both stocks, the main impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the highest prices recorded between 01/01/2019 and 10/01/2024. It can be observed that, despite the significant drop during the pandemic, both stocks exhibited a strong recovery afterward.

# MGLU3, BOVA11, Dollar and Ibovespa

In this project, also using the yfinance library, I analyzed BOVA11 (an ETF that tracks the Ibovespa index) and MGLU3 (the stock of Magazine Luiza, one of Brazil’s leading retail companies). The analysis included a visualization of both assets’ closing prices and the moving average of Magazine Luiza’s stock.
Additionally, I collected data on the Ibovespa index and the US dollar (quoted in Brazilian reais). A key finding concerns the behavior of the exchange rate following adjustments to the SELIC rate (Brazil’s benchmark interest rate): the dollar did not react as typically expected to a rate increase, suggesting that the country’s fiscal and political conditions were dampening the usual effects of monetary policy. Later, in December 2024, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the interest rate by 1%, yet the dollar reached historic highs.

# LaTeX  
While not directly related to data science, the skills I developed while creating these projects enable me to provide significant contributions through LaTeX documents, which are important for producing high-quality reports for clients or internal company use. This programming language is excellent for writing mathematical symbols, equations, plotting graphics, and formatting technical text.  
Among the packages I used in these documents are: amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, pgfplots, and tikz.  

Samples of my work are presented below. These documents were created for personal use during exam preparation and served as summaries of the studied content.
